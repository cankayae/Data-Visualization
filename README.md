Figure 1 presents the minimum price value of properties in Volusia county over time (2017-2020). The median months since the sale is also reflected in the figure. As seen in Figure 1, there is a linear trend between minimum property price and sale year, which implies that there was an increase in the minimum property price as time passed.  On the other hand, the median months since sale decreased from 46 to 8 over time, suggesting that properties were selling at a faster rate over time.  
![Figure 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82909354/116007805-81dd8300-a5df-11eb-88b9-cd93b95932d2.png)

Figure 2 is a bar graph and reflects the average price value of properties in Volusia county over the last four years. As seen in Figure 2, the height of the bars reflecting average property price follows a linear trend (blue line). While the average property price was $200,088 in the second quarter of 2017, the average property price exceeded the 250K range starting in the third quarter of 2019 (between July-September). The highest average property value was reported in the third quarter of 2020 as $274,225 and the average price slightly decreased in the last quarter of 2020 to $274,221. The orange-colored line reflects the median months since the sale and the median months since sale over time, implying that properties were selling within a shorter time as time passed.

The same information reflected in Figure 2 was also shown in Figure 3 using a line graph and removing the bars. The median months of sale was added to the line of fit.

Figure 4 includes 4 dimensions: (1) sum of property price, (2) year of sale, (3) median months of sale and (4) zip code. The reason I added zip code is because it plays a role in predicting property price. As reflected in the visual using different colors, the median months of sale decreased over time.  While the median months sale was a larger value close to 50 in 2017 (circles shown in red color), the median months sale drastically decreased in 2020 (circles shown in purple color). Moreover, Figure 4 shows that properties located in same zip codes remained relatively in the same price range with a few exceptions. As pointed out in the figure, the sum of property values in 32124 drastically increased from $33,702 in 2017 to $363,515 in 2020 ($119,723 in 2018 AND $346,799 in 2019).
